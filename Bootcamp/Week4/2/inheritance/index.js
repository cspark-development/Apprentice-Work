/*
A parent Shape class has been declared with a color property and draw() method.
1. Declare a Circle class that extends the Shape class.
2. Create code that gives the Circle class have the following properties and methods:
- Properties
    - color inherited from the Shape class.
    - radius set by the Circle class.
- Methods
    - draw() inherited from the Shape class.
    - calculateArea() that returns the area of the circle. The area of a  
    - circle is calculated by the formula Area = Ï€r^2. You can use 3.14 or Math.PI for the value of pi.
3. Run your code.
4. Test your code.
