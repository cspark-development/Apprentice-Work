/*
In ./db/connection.js:

    Inside the const { Sequelize }, include DataTypes and Model as well.
    Inside the module.exports = { db } add the DataTypes and Model.

In index.js:

    Require db, DataTypes, and Model from the already complete sequelize connection (from ./db/connection.js) at the top of the file.
    Create a Product class that extends the Model.
    Call Product.init() and pass it two objects as arguments:
    In the first object argument, initialize the table with 3 columns:
        name: a string
        description: a string
        price: an integer
    In the second object:
        Define a key of sequelize and pass it the database connection
        Define a key of modelName and define the model as "Product"
    Run your code. Again, there isnâ€™t much to see yet, but you can use console.log to help debug if you are running into problems!
    Test your code.
