/*
In App.js:

    At the top of the file, import { useState } from the ‚Äôreact‚Äô package.
    Inside the App function, initialize a new piece of state called index and a corresponding setter function that will track the index of the array. Initialize index with a value of 0.
    Create a function called updateAnimal that does the following:
        If index is currently not at the end of the array, then increment index by 1.
        If the index is currently the last value in the array, update index to 0.
    Pass two props to Animal:
        data that equals the animal with the current index. E.g. If index is 1, then data should equal the Giraffe object.
        updateAnimal that is equal to the updateAnimal function.
